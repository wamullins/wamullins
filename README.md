  I am a software engineer who is motivated by working on challenging problems both individually and in collaborative settings. From my previous work in neuroscience research, Iâ€™ve developed skills in problem solving, data manipulation, interpersonal communication, and public speaking. I use my passion for learning to untangle complex issues in back-end architecture as well as build up efficient and intuitive front-end interfaces.

## [Brain Atlas](https://github.com/wamullins/BrainAtlas)

### Mongoose/Express/Node 

Brain Atlas allows the user to search through the various structures in our brains using a visual interface and see information about each region. The main purpose of this project iss to tie together information from various sources through a navagatable, sketched brain model and allow users to add additonial research that they think is relevant. At each information page about a various region, the user is also given reseach articles that are related to this region of the brain. Any user can submit an article to be added to the database; however, first the article must be approved by an administrator through the admin portal. In the admin control page, an admin can search for articles by brain region or by unapproved status. THe admin can then choose whether or not to approve the article and have it show up or delete it (admin can also delete articles after they have been approved).
